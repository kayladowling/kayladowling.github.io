title: AngularJS $scope & this
---

One of the first things you learn with AngularJS is the amazing two-way data binding abilities of *$scope*. *$scope*, directives, and curly brackets can magically add content to your website. 

But what is *$scope*?  *$scope* is context or the glue between controllers and html. If you have been programming with Javascript for a while the word context might sound familiar with the keyword *this*. If you do a google search, the below definition will appear.

Have you ever considered using this instead of $scope? Below is an example. Some AngularJS style guides consider the use of  *$scope* bad practice, and use the keyword *this* instead.
