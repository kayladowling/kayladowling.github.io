Backbone.js provides components such as models, collections, and views that give structure to an application. The importance of these components is decreasing the dependence of different parts of the code, which protects the application from breaking if one part of the code fails. Backbone uses the Underscore.js.

As a real life example, imagine models as individual people. A model holds the properties that make that person unique. A collection is a group of people models. Extend is used to provide an instance of properties for models, collections, and views.

A collection is an array of models. Many of the Javascript array native methods can be used on collections.

A view is a DOM node and unless specifically set, a view is div element. Multiple views can be used for collections and models.
