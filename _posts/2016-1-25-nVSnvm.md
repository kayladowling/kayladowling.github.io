#The downside of npm install -g n#

Through a google search, I found the below solution for switching node.js verison.

The problem with installing n, unless you are 100% sure nvm (Node Version Management) is not installed, it will cause a conflict with n, which may lead to node.js not working properly. I'm sharing this knowledge, because it happen to me.

What is n? According to it’s github it is a  “Simple flavour of node/iojs binary management, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just simple.” You can find their github here: https://github.com/tj/n.

You can find for information here on nvm : https://github.com/creationix/nvm.

Although, n and nvm allow you to install a new node version. However, you can’t use both. To avoid conflicts, input nvm
in the terminal to make sure it is not installed before installing n.
