#The downside of *n*#

Through a google search, I found the below solution for switching the node.js verison.

The problem with installing *n*, unless you are 100% sure *nvm* (node version management) is not installed, it will cause a conflict with *nvm*, which may lead to node.js not working properly. This happen to me.

What is *n*? According to it’s github it is a  “Simple flavour of node/iojs binary management, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just simple.” 

You can find more information on *n* and *nvm* here: [https://github.com/tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n) [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) 

Although, *n* and *nvm* allow you to install a new node version. Using both will cause a conflict. To avoid conflicts, input *nvm* in the terminal to make sure it is not installed before installing *n*.
