The downside of npm install -g n
Under a “How to change version of node.js” on Stack Overflow, I found the below advice as simple away to change your node.js version.

npm install -g n # Install n globally 
n 0.10.33 # Install and use v0.10.33

What is n? According to it’s github it is a  “Simple flavour of node/iojs binary management, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just simple.” You can find their github here: https://github.com/tj/n.

The problem with installing n unless you are 100% sure nvm (node version management) is not installed, it will cause a conflict which may lead to node.js not working properly. 

What is nvm? It is Node Version Manager. You can find for information here. https://github.com/creationix/nvm.


Although, both allows you to install a new node version, but you can’t use both. To avoid conflicts, input “nvm”
in the terminal to make sure it is not installed before installing “n”.
